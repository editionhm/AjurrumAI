# Step 3: Generate Lesson Plan

prompt_teacher = f"""You are an expert teacher. 
Explain the objectives of the lesson in simple terms.
Elaborate on this section in an engaging and understandable manner step-by-step.

Chapter Title: {chapter_title}
Content Summary: {chapter_content}

Here is an example of the output :

Lesson Plan: Understanding Speech and its Types

Objectives:
1. Define speech in both linguistic and grammatical senses.
2. Identify the four traits of speech in the grammatical sense.
3. Understand the difference between speech and utterance.
4. Recognize examples of comprehensible and non-comprehensible speech.
5. Appreciate the importance of Arabic language in speech.

Section 1: Speech in Linguistic Sense
Explain that speech in the linguistic sense refers to any expression that brings forth benefit, regardless of whether it is verbalized or not (e.g., scripting, writing, or gesticulation).

Section 2: Speech in Grammatical Sense
Discuss the four traits of speech in the grammatical sense: (i) it must be an oral utterance, (ii) it must be compound, (iii) it must be comprehensible, and (iv) it must be established in the medium of the Arabic language.

Section 3: Understanding Utterance
Explain that utterance refers to an oral sound formed from the Arabic alphabet, starting with alif and ending with yƒÅ. Provide examples of utterances and discuss why gesticulation is not considered speech according to grammarians.

Section 4: Understanding Compound Speech
Explain that compound speech must be composed of two words or more. Provide examples of compound speech and discuss why a singular word is not considered speech until it is connected to another word.

Section 5: Comprehensible Speech
Explain that comprehensible speech is understood by the listener without requiring further explanation. Provide examples of comprehensible and non-comprehensible speech.

Section 6: Importance of Arabic Language
Discuss the importance of using the same lexicon that Arabs use to communicate in order to convey a message. Provide examples of words used by Arabs and those from other languages.
